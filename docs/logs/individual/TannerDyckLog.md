## Tasks Completed:
I have completed the following tasks either alone or in collaboration with my teammates. As we are still in the early stages of our project's development, our team is largely focused on working collaboratively to nail down our project specifications and documents. In the coming weeks, I'm sure our workload and tasks will start to diverge from one another.

- Finalized and submitted project proposal (issue #8)
- Worked on system architecture design (issue #9)
- Finalized system architecture design after instructor feedback (issue #9)
- Filled out peer reviews for week #4
- Completed "project proposal" canvas assignment
- Individual Logs Week 4 (issue #10)
