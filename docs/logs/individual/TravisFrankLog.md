# Week 8 Personal Log (Oct 20th – Oct 26th)

This week I focused on implementing a new feature that validates file formats during directory and zip file scans. The update integrates the `is_valid_format` function into `scan.py`, ensuring that only supported file types are processed while unsupported ones are skipped with clear messages. I also added unit tests to verify correct behavior across valid, invalid, and edge-case filenames. In addition I continued contributing to code quality by reviewing teammates’ PRs and ensuring consistency across our testing and documentation standards.
