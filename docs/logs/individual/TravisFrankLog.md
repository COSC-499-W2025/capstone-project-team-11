# Week 9 Personal Log (Oct 27th – Nov 2nd)

This week I began implementing **Issue #29: Identify Individual Contributions Within a Collaborative Project**, which focuses on mapping file authorship and contributions across Git repositories. I also reviewed **PR #107** (Development bug fixes) and **PR #109** (Issue #19: Solve Projects Chronologically), providing feedback to ensure smooth functionality and consistent testing coverage. In addition, I resolved merge conflicts between the **Contribution Metrics** feature branch and the **Development** branch to maintain alignment across ongoing feature work. Lastly, I completed my individual log for this cycle.

Overall, the week went well, I made pretty good progress on my assigned issue, but had to spend time refacotring after other pushes. All tests ran successfully after the merge. However, resolving the couple merge conflicts highlighted the need for clearer team communication about where and when changes are being made in the repository. Improving coordination will help prevent overlapping edits and make integration smoother in future cycles. I also learned more about how different features interact across modules, which will help with upcoming implementation work.

# Week 10 Personal Log (Nov 3rd – Nov 9th)

This week i had some midterms so I focused on implementing a bug fix for my previous task related to the contribution summary. My fix (PR #133) refined the data handling and ensured that the contribution summary correctly reports the number of files changed and which specific files were modified per contributor. This update aligned the results with the latest database persistence changes and improved overall reporting accuracy. After applying the fix, all related tests passed successfully, confirming stable integration across modules. 

In addition to the bug fix, I participated in peer code reviews for PR #131 (Database persistence integration) and PR #134 (File metadata handling improvements). These reviews focused on verifying data consistency, testing reliability, and adherence to project design standards. Overall, the week was productive in maintaining stability and supporting team progress toward our milestone, as are starting to deepen the analysis of out features

---

# Week 12 Personal Log (Nov 10th – Nov 23rd)

This week I implemented a new contributor-focused project summarization feature. My update (PR #158) added a full implementation of `summarize_projects.py`, which analyzes a contributor’s top-ranked projects from the database, gathers project metadata, and generates one combined summary file. The summary includes languages, skills, frameworks, contribution metrics, ranking breakdowns, and per-project details. The feature resolves project paths, handles missing/invalid paths, aggregates all stats cleanly, and produces a readable multi-section report. It’s completely standalone and can be run manually through the CLI without affecting the main scanning pipeline. I also added a comprehensive test suite covering path resolution, skipping invalid projects, info-gathering behavior, error handling, and limit enforcement. All automated tests passed, and manual runs produced correct summary files.

As a group, I feel we had a solid week. We expanded our reporting tools and kept everything aligned as we move toward the end of Milestone 1. Over the next couple of weeks, we’ll need to come together to tighten up our product for the demo, which I believe we will.

# Week 13 Personal Log (Nov 24th – Nov 30th)

This week I implemented the full `main_menu.py` module (PR #181), which now acts as the unified CLI interface for all major MDA features. The menu consolidates scanning, ranking, project summaries, and full database inspection into one consistent entry point. The update includes a complete set of helper utilities, support for per-project and contributor-level reporting, and a much cleaner workflow for interacting with the SQLite database. I also added a full test suite (`test_main_menu.py`) that covers the deterministic logic in the module, including `safe_query()`, `human_ts()`, and the database inspection handler. All tests passed successfully, and the new menu structure should make the user-facing experience much more organized heading into Milestone 1.

As a group, we also spent time preparing and refining our presentation slides for the Milestone 1 demo. We synced our individual logs, reviewed each other's PRs, and made sure the reporting and analysis features aligned well with what we want to showcase. Overall, it was a productive week, and I feel confident with where our project stands heading into the final stretch of Milestone 1.

# Week 14 Personal Log (Dec 1st – Dec 7th)

This week was busy as our team wrapped up the remaining Milestone 1 tasks and finalized our deliverables. We divided the remaining work across the group, and I focused on a mix of development fixes, architecture updates, and documentation as most of our coding was done.

One of my main contributions was **PR #212**, which fixes a Windows file path issue that caused summary generation to fail. The update standardizes how paths are parsed and makes the summary and reporting tools work consistently across both macOS and Windows environments. I also spent time updating our **system architecture diagram** so it accurately reflects the Milestone 1 implementation. This included organizing the layers, clarifying the flow between the CLI, scanners, detection engine, and database, and adding the resume output and consent/config elements. The updated diagram now gives a clean, accurate overview of how the system behaves end-to-end.

I feel it has been a succecsul milestone/semester and am happy with where our project is at thus far.

# Semester 2 – Week 1 Personal Log (January 5th - 11th, 2026)

During the first week of Semester 2, the team regrouped following the reading break to transition into Milestone 2 development. We reviewed feedback from Milestone 1, clarified technical priorities, and began implementing features aimed at strengthening project traceability and portfolio readiness. My primary focus this week was contributing to the backend design and CLI integration of the Project Evidence module, establishing infrastructure to support richer reporting and résumé-generation outputs later in the milestone.

Overall, this was a highly productive first week back. Establishing a clean, testable evidence layer early in Milestone 2 positions the team well for building more advanced reporting and export features, and I’m excited to see how it integrates with our existing contribution metrics.

# Semester 2 – Week 2 Personal Log (January 12th – 18th, 2026)

During Week 2 of Semester 2, my focus shifted toward completing the full integration of the Project Evidence feature across downstream outputs and reviewing ongoing team contributions as Milestone 2 development continued. Building on the backend and CLI groundwork established last week, I finalized the flow for surfacing evidence data within résumé and portfolio generation pipelines, ensuring the feature was end-to-end complete and aligned with Milestone 2 objectives. In parallel, I spent time reviewing teammate pull requests and researching potential LLM options to inform future integration decisions.

This week felt like a strong follow-through on earlier design decisions. Completing the evidence integration into résumé and portfolio outputs closes a major Milestone 2 feature and significantly improves the system’s ability to generate meaningful, evidence-backed artifacts.

<img width="981" height="629" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 3 29 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c48a6f0-6430-4a27-9400-9f65cafce1c5" />

# Semester 2 – Week 3 Personal Log (January 19th – January 25th, 2026)

This week the team focused primarily on stabilization and polish in preparation for upcoming peer testing. Rather than introducing new features, we prioritized addressing bugs, cleanup tasks, identified through Milestone 1 feedback. This allowed us to improve overall system reliability and ensure existing functionality behaves consistently ahead of external testing.

My individual work focused on fixing correctness issues in contributor-based reporting and improving the reliability of summary-generation workflows. I resolved a bug in portfolio generation where git-tracked projects were incorrectly included even when the selected user was not a contributor. I also improved summarize_projects.py workflow based on Milestone 1 feedback. This included adding a guided contributor-selection prompt to the CLI, fixing an issue where per-contributor commit counts were incorrectly reported as zero, and ensuring summaries correctly reflect the selected contributor’s commits while preserving total project metrics. I will look into switching this feature to pull project info from Db next week.


<img width="1118" height="650" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-25 at 7 19 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1a373d-5788-4e77-9fb6-0b754da69295" />


## Coding Tasks
- Fixed portfolio aggregation logic to exclude git-tracked projects when the selected user is not a contributor, while preserving support for non-git and solo projects (PR #291)  
- Improved the **Summarize Contributor Projects** workflow based on Milestone 1 feedback, including guided contributor selection and more accurate contributor-specific commit reporting (PR #315)  
- Corrected per-contributor commit count handling to ensure summaries reflect the selected user’s actual commits while preserving overall project Git metrics
- Hardened zip-based project handling to prevent invalid or multi-project directories from being summarized silently  

## Testing Tasks
- Added unit test `test_aggregate_projects_excludes_non_contributor_git_project` in `test_generate_portfolio.py` to verify portfolio aggregation excludes non-contributor git projects  
- Added new unit tests in `test_summarize_projects.py` to validate contributor-based summary fixes:
  - `test_contributor_commit_count_is_used`
  - `test_skills_are_populated_correctly`
  - `test_fallback_to_contributions_commits`
- Performed manual CLI testing via `main_menu.py` to verify contributor selection, summary accuracy, and zip-based project handling  

## Reviewing / Collaboration Tasks
- Reviewed **Docker updates & test suite refactors** (PR #288)  
- Reviewed **Add project résumé display name editing** (PR #294)  
- Reviewed **Added tests for nested folders** (PR #300)  
- Coordinated with teammates to align on Milestone 2 priorities and upcoming integration work  

<img width="1103" height="148" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-25 at 8 25 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0ac3304-973f-4d67-bbf5-2528a457f3f4" />

# Semester 2 – Weeks 4 + 5 Personal Log (January 26th – February 8th, 2026)

During Weeks 4 and 5 of Semester 2, the team continued Milestone 2 development with a strong focus on reliability, usability, and polish. During **Week 4**, we conducted peer testing, which helped surface a concrete list of bugs, usability issues, and unclear workflows across the system. Based on this feedback, we shifted focus away from adding new features and instead prioritized implementing fixes and refinements identified through peer testing.

In Week 4, I completed **PR #326**, which refactored project summary generation to rely exclusively on database-backed data rather than filesystem scans. This change significantly improved performance, consistency, and correctness by ensuring summaries reflect the canonical persisted state of the system. The update also included additional initialization checks and new tests to guard against invalid or incomplete database state.

In Week 5, my focus shifted toward UX polish and clarity in Milestone 2 features. I addressed confusing terminology in the **Project Evidence** workflow by renaming and re-framing labels to better communicate intent to users (e.g., “Evidence of Success”), improving overall usability and reducing cognitive overhead. I also began work on refining the file extension filtering experience in the scanning workflow, evaluating whether the prompt should be clarified or removed entirely based on user feedback.

# Semester 2 – Weeks 6–8 Personal Log (February 9th – March 1st, 2026)

During Weeks 6 through 8, the team transitioned from stabilizing Milestone 2 features toward beginning early groundwork for Milestone 3. Week 7 was our Reading Break (counted as a bonus week), during which development slowed, but planning and research continued. Across this period, my focus shifted toward preparing our system for frontend integration and ensuring backend endpoints were structured appropriately for visualization and external access.

In Week 6, I contributed to backend improvements supporting milestone transition work (PR #385). This included refining API-related functionality to ensure it remained consistent and reliable as we prepared to expose more structured data externally.

During Week 8, I completed PR #392, which involved scaffolding an initial Electron + Vite frontend and testing backend connectivity. Alongside implementation, I spent time researching best practices for structuring a successful frontend architecture that cleanly connects to our FastAPI backend. This research focused on project structure, API routing patterns, and separation of concerns to ensure our frontend remains maintainable as Milestone 3 visualization features expand.

In addition to development work, we prepared and delivered our Milestone 2 presentation, reviewing system improvements, demonstration flows, and integration decisions made throughout the milestone.
