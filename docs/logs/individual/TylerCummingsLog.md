# Tyler's T2 Week 4/5 Personal Log (Jan. 26 - Feb. 8)
[Back to Term 2 Navigation](#)

Focus of the past two weeks was on **database management improvements** and **removing deprecated functionality** from the project. I completed three major tasks:

1. Added functionality for clearing the database and deleting individual projects, including cascading deletes for related tables.
2. Extended the `clear_database` function to remove generated project output folders while keeping the main output directory intact.
3. Removed the deprecated “Generate Project Summary Report” feature, updated the main menu numbering, and fixed related tests.

These changes improve maintainability, ensure project data can be fully reset for testing, and clean up the user interface for project management.

<img width="977" height="568" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d57fb29b-5293-435a-bb6a-0a1140740be7" />

---

## Coding Tasks

- Implemented `clear_database()` to remove all data from every table while preserving the schema.
- Created `delete_project_by_id(project_id)` to delete a specific project and all dependent rows in related tables.
- Developed `remove_project_menu()` and `database_management_menu()` to allow interactive deletion of projects and full database clearing.
- Added `_clear_output_directory()` to delete all subfolders inside `src/output` when clearing the database while keeping the output folder itself.
- Removed deprecated project summary functionality:
  - Deleted `gather_project_info`, `output_project_info`, and `handle_generate_project_summary`.
  - Updated `main_menu.py` numbering:  
    - Option 9: Manage Evidence of Success  
    - Option 10: Analyze Contributor Roles  
    - Option 11: Edit Thumbnail for a Project  
    - Option 12: Manage Database
- Updated menu handlers to reflect the removed option and ensure consistent behavior.

---

## Testing / Debugging Tasks

- Wrote `test_db_clear_and_delete_project.py` to verify:
  - Clearing the database empties all tables.
  - Deleting a project removes the project and all related rows.
  - Invalid or `None` project IDs are handled gracefully.
- Wrote `test_db_clear_output_directory.py` to verify:
  - Subfolders in `src/output` are deleted when clearing the database.
  - The main output directory remains intact.
- Updated main menu test to reflect new menu numbering.
- Manual verification:
  - Menu prints correctly and functions work interactively.
  - Project deletion, database clearing, and output folder removal behave as expected.

---

## Reviewing / Collaboration Tasks

- Reviewed teammates' code changes, PRs, and bug fixes ([PR #354], [PR #357], [PR #360]) and [PR #361]).
- Scheduled weekly meetings on monday
- Since we didnt have time to do the checkin on wednesday we spent the entire time discussing the future of our project, what work needs to be done and changes in communication to streamline our project and be more efficient.
- Completed team log for week 4/5

---

## Blockers / Issues

- Minor conflicts between new output-folder deletion logic and existing tests, resolved by cleaning temporary directories properly.
- Needed careful adjustment of menu numbering and test assertions to prevent breaking automated tests.

---

## T2 Week 6 Plans

- Work on PT issues
- #2 validate paths of files scanned
- #16 Fix depreciation warning on resume generation

<img width="1896" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db6fc244-37d4-45ee-954e-8c9cef44c26e" />

# Tyler's T2 Week 6-8 Personal Log (Feb. 9 - Mar. 1)
[Back to Term 2 Navigation](#)

Focus of the past two weeks was on **the last peer request improvements**, **preparing for presentation** and **completing the M2 video**. I completed four major tasks:

1. Fixed file paths to work for both relative and absolute paths as recommended from peer testing
2. Removed depreciated timestamp code in resume generation and regeneration
3. Created slides, script and dummy questions/answers for the Q/A for our team to practice on to be ready for the presentation
4. Created and recorded a script and video for the milestone 2 video.

These changes improve flexibility, user experience, and clean up the user interface for project management. Additionally they worked towards completing mandatory parts of the capstone project

**Still need image of here from peer review**

---

## Coding Tasks

- Fixed import error in `test_relative_paths.py` by explicitly inserting the `src` directory into `sys.path`, ensuring tests run correctly regardless of working directory.
- Standardized relative and absolute path handling in `scan.py`:
  - Converted input paths to absolute using `os.path.abspath`.
  - Added validation to ensure the path exists before scanning.
  - Ensured consistent behavior for both internal callers and CLI usage.
- Improved ZIP file detection logic to work correctly with normalized absolute paths.
- Eliminated deprecated UTC timestamp usage in resume generation:
  - Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in both `generate_resume.py` and `regenerate_resume.py`.
  - Ensured a single UTC timestamp is used consistently for both:
    - Resume content (`ts_iso`)
    - Resume filename (`ts_fname`)
- Maintained parity between resume generation and resume regeneration logic to prevent inconsistent behavior.
- Ensured no duplicate or conflicting timestamp variables remained after refactor.
- Verified that no new dependencies were introduced.

---

## Testing / Debugging Tasks

- Added `test_relative_paths.py` to validate:
  - Relative paths work correctly when the working directory changes.
  - Absolute and relative paths produce identical results.
  - Nested directory files are discovered when `recursive=True`.
- Ran full test suite using: pytest -v
- Confirmed all tests pass (260 passing).
- Manual verification steps performed:
- Fresh clone of the repository.
- Scanned multiple projects (both inside repo and external directories).
- Generated resume via CLI — no timezone deprecation warnings.
- Regenerated resume — no timezone deprecation warnings.
- Generated portfolio — no timestamp warnings.
- Verified behavior on Windows environment.
- Confirmed relative path handling works across different directory contexts.

---

## Reviewing / Collaboration Tasks

- Reviewed teammates' code changes, PRs, and bug fixes ([PR #384], [PR #385]
- Attended weekly meetings on monday
- Had multiple calls to discuss creating and practicing for our presentation and met after the presentation to discuss the video and weeks tasks
- Completed slides, script, demo/practice Q/A and video 

---

## Blockers / Issues

- Initial import issue in `test_relative_paths.py` due to inconsistent `src` resolution; resolved by explicitly inserting the correct path into `sys.path`.
- Needed to carefully refactor timestamp logic to avoid duplicate variable assignments and ensure both resume and regeneration flows used the same UTC-aware implementation.
- Ensured compatibility across operating systems when resolving relative paths.

---

## T2 Week 9 Plans

- Start work on milestone 3 specifically start with the front end and dashboard
- **specific task here**
- **specific task here**

**need to put image in here of my items**
