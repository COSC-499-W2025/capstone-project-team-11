Testing Report:  
All six unit tests in `config_test.py` passed successfully on multiple systems. The tests validate key behaviors, including:
- Loading a non-existent config file defaults correctly.
- Saving and reloading a valid config file works as intended.
- Invalid JSON gracefully falls back to defaults.
- Explicit arguments correctly override saved settings.
- `run_with_saved_settings()` accurately applies saved configurations.
- Saved settings persist correctly between sessions and can be overwritten or recreated.

Manual testing confirmed successful integration with `scan.py`, ensuring accurate reuse of saved configurations and reliable creation of the `.mda/config.json` file.  
All functionality works as expected on macOS and Linux systems.

Reflection:
- The new configuration feature made the program much more user-friendly, reducing repetitive inputs and improving session persistence.  
- Collaboration and code review were smooth this week, and the README improvements helped clarify the project for new contributors.  
- The testing process showed strong team coordination, and maintaining a clean PR workflow made merging new functionality straightforward.
- We all had a busy week with midterms and will be looking to add more funcionality in the coming weeks

Planning Activities (Week 8):  
- Complete parsing functionality for complicated zipped folders (`#22`).  
- Implement data access consent logic and integrate it into the workflow (`#21`).  
- Add error handling for incorrect file formats (`#23`).

Overview:
This week, our team focused on expanding the core functionality of the file scanning system by implementing new modules and improving robustness across the codebase. Several new files were added includint consent.py, detect_langs.py, and file_utils.py which faciltate major enhacnements in order to handle consent validation, language detection, and file format checking. Additionally, scan.py was enhanced to be able to scan complicated zip files as well as determine collaboration in git repositories. The team also began developing a persistent storage system for scan history and file metadata. A new database schema and supporting scripts were introduced to establish the foundation for structured data management within the project.

Testing Report:
All unit tests passed successfully on multiple systems. The test suite was expanded to include new unit and integration tests covering the recently added files:

1. consent_test.py  
    - Simulated user consent prompts to confirm valid/invalid input behavior.
    - Verified that consent decisions are saved and retrieved correctly between sessions.
    - Confirmed that scans cannot proceed without user consent.  
2. files_utils_test.py
    - Verified that is_valid_format() correctly identifies supported file extensions.
    - Tested handling of invalid, hidden, and extensionless files.
    - Confirmed that unsupported formats are skipped gracefully with clear console messages.
3. detect_langs_test.py
    - Verified that language and framework detection correctly identifies common project types              (Python, C++, Java).
    - Ensured accurate detection from directory structures and file contents.
4. scan_test.py
    - Verified that when scanning a ZIP file non-recursively, only top-level files are listed while         nested files are ignored.
    - Confirmed that file-type filters (e.g., .py, .txt) apply correctly inside ZIP archives.
    - Ensured recursive scanning correctly traverses nested ZIPs, displaying inner files with full          hierarchical paths.
    - Verified that in environments without a Git repository (such as a temporary directory), the          "Collaboration: unknown" instead of failing or returning incorrect data.scanner correctly              reports.
  
5. test_db.py
   - Verified that the SQLite database initializes correctly with scans and files tables.
   - Tested insertion of dummy scan and file records to confirm table structure and constraints.
   - Ensured that table data can be retrieved and printed cleanly for debugging and validation.

Reflection:
- Our team made significant progress this week by integrating multiple independent features (consent validation, language detection, file format filtering, ZIP handling, and collaborator detection) into a cohesive and robust scanning workflow.
- The modular design of new components like consent.py, file_utils.py, and detect_langs.py improved overall code organization and testability.
- Handling complex nested ZIPs was a major technical challenge, but successful implementation and testing confirmed that the scanner can now reliably handle recursive archives.
- Adding file format validation increased the system’s safety by preventing unsupported or unsafe files from being processed during scans.
- The addition of the database schema introduced our first persistent data layer, helping us understand how to manage and query scan history efficiently.
- The collaborator detection feature enhanced traceability and transparency by linking scanned files to their respective Git contributors.
- The team demonstrated strong collaboration during pull request reviews, resolving merge conflicts efficiently and maintaining consistent code quality standards.
- Comprehensive testing ensured that all new modules worked seamlessly across platforms, reinforcing the reliability of the codebase.

Planning Activities (Week 9):
- Start workaround anaysis if user denies external service permissions (#25).

  Overview: This week,our team focused on advancing collaboration features, database integration, and skill analysis within the file scanning system. Several new modules were added, including collab_summary.py, contrib_metrics.py, and rank_projects.py, which collectively enhance collaboration insights and data visibility. These updates enable detection of individual contributions across Git and non-Git projects, commit-level analytics, and chronological project ranking based on scan activity. The detect_skills.py module was also introduced to automatically infer technical and writing-based skills using regex pattern matching, extending the functionality of the language detection system.
In addition, improvements were made to database persistence and Docker reliability, ensuring consistent behavior between local and containerized environments. The team resolved multiple configuration and prompt-related bugs, streamlined scan logic, and refined user interaction flows. Together, these contributions significantly expanded the project’s analytical capabilities—allowing for integrated tracking of languages, skills, collaboration, and scan data persistence within a unified workflow.

## Overview:
This week, we focused on completing smaller, more nuanced tasks than in previous weeks, where we have aimed to implement big-ticket scanner features and milestone deliverables.
Everyone has been keeping their own lists of bugs they come across, whether it is within a feature they developed or within features made by others. 
When we met in person for our TA check-in, we took inventory of issues we wanted to address and assigned tasks accordingly.

Our database is more comprehensive and capable than it was last week. Jaxson ensured that all relevant details collected during scans have a home in the database so that they can be accessed later as we improve our scanner's report/summary generation. Daniel made a note of some inconsistencies in the "Display contribution metrics for git projects" feature he developed in week 9, so he dove back into it and reworked how git authors' names are displayed. It was a worthwhile improvement as now we have a canonical naming convention for github usernames, which improves readability and clarity in generated reports. Priyanshu was in a position to implement a new feature, so he allowed for the displaying of chronologically-sorted skills, as they were found in a user's saved scans from the database, which was made easier with Jaxson's recent database revisions. Now users can generate a comprehensive timeline of skills exercised, allowing them to view how their aptitudes have changed/progressed over time, and across projects. I (Tanner) wanted to improve the accuracy and consistency of our "Detect programming languages/frameworks within coding projects" feature. So I added a detection method to be used alongside our first method. detect_langs.py now reads each file in a project and uses a pre-defined set of REGEX syntax patterns for a wide array of languages to find occurrences of unique languages within files. The feature still needs a lot more revision, and I hope to continue to improve it in the coming weeks. Travis, like Daniel, noticed some bugs/inconsistencies in his collaboration summary from last week's sprint, so he made sure it was corrected last week. Now, after his fixes, the collaboration summary is more accurate and comprehensive, and for each GitHub user in the project, it displays how many commits they have made, the total number of files in the project they have contributed to, and the exact files they have worked on. Tyler implemented a new feature: the ability to choose to export a report of a scan in both JSON and .txt formats. This is an excellent addition, as it is a feature that is at the core of the project. We have spent a long time creating the logic for our scanner to operate by, but now we have a tangible exported summary of a scan done on a creative project. Overall, I believe we accomplished a lot this week. We made some necessary improvements to pre-existing features and even programmed a few additional features that our program was lacking.

- Completion of individual logs and peer reviews

## Testing Report:
All new and existing unit tests continue to pass successfully across both local and Docker environments. Validation was conducted through a combination of automated and manual testing.

### collab_summary_test.py:
- Added unit test for per-author file tracking in Git repos:
- Git repo should include per-author changed files in the contribution summary
- Creates and commits a file
- Ensures the author appears and the file list contains the changed file

### contrib_metrics_test.py
- Added more tests and a feature that hides any author with zero commits:
- Normalize author identity using email (preferred) or name
- Handles GitHub noreply addresses like 12345+username@users.noreply.github.com
- Automatically normalize author identity for any git repo by stripping away special symbols

### inspect_db.py
- Added chronological skills timeline to inspect_db output:
- Looks at the earliest scan date where each skill was detected in a project
- MIN(scanned_at) gives the first time that the skill appeared in any scan
- Sorting by first_seen shows a "timeline" of when skills were exercised

### test_db_updates.py
- Added new unit tests to validate database functionality. Uses temporary databases for isolated test runs. Tests include:
- table creation
- per-file linking for languages and contributors
- fallback behaviour when per-file metadata is missing
- verification for repeated scans

### test_detect_langs.py
- Creates a temporary Python file and writes some basic Python code within it, uses the new pattern-based detection method to ensure the pre-programmed REGEX patterns are working properly by checking that the pattern match count is greater than 0
- Confirms all 5 confidence scenarios are generating correctly (High - 2 cases, Medium - 2 cases, Low - 1 trivial case)
- Checks that confidence levels are calculated and included in the final output of results by making sure that a Python file (with .py extension) with some basic code returns "high" confidence

## Team Reflection:
Our team worked very well together this week. We all had busy weeks (other projects being due, second-wave midterms, etc.), but we communicated effectively and frequently. 
We made good use of our Discord server to keep each other in the loop when we could not meet in person, and we utilized our TA check-in time wisely by prioritizing tasks to be completed during the busy week ahead. 
Everyone provided their individual timelines and ETAs around when they hoped to have their PRs up and ready for review, and I'm proud to say everyone was pretty accurate. No late-night rushes to merge our Development branch to main; everything was completed in a convenient and timely manner.
We also decided to be proactive and discuss what we hope to accomplish as a team in the upcoming two weeks (weeks 11 *Reading Break*, and 12) ahead of time. Nobody seems to have any complaints about our most recent sprint, and we look forward to the next!

## Planned Activities (Week 11 *Reading Break* & Week 12):
This upcoming week (week 11) is Reading Break, so our contributions may vary between team members depending on individual availability (travelling, visiting family, etc.).
As for week 12, we have discussed it as a team and decided that we hope to:
- Revise "Rank projects chronologically" Issue #146
- Continue revising "Detect programming languages/frameworks used within coding projects" Issue #129
- Implement "Delete Previously Generated Insights" Issue #38 (didn't get to it in week 10 as planned)
- Implement "Rank Project Importance Based on User's Contributions" Issue #36
- Implement "Summarize the User's Top-Ranked Projects" Issue #37
- General bug-fixes that we notice during testing/implementation

test_summarize_projects.py
- Validated correct path resolution across several edge cases: Nonexistent or empty projects, returned None when no scans exist and returned None when scans exist but no associated files exist.
- Correctly identified project root using .git directory, even when scanned files were deep in nested subdirectories.
- Verified that a top-level README.md correctly marks the project’s root directory.
- Confirmed correct extraction of base file path when stored paths use archive.zip:/inner/file.py format.
- Ensured the latest scan’s files are used for project path derivation.
- Validated empty result for nonexistent contributor names.
- Confirmed stable behavior even when ranker returns empty lists.
- Verified summaries gracefully degrade with: project_path = None and error = "Project path not found" (No crashes or propagation of invalid paths.)
- Confirmed complete summary generation when: Valid project path exists, README and source files present
- Ensured summaries include: Project name, Project path, Contributor ranking metrics, File counts


Manual testing confirmed:
- Improved language detection accuracy
- Correct metadata extraction from Git
- Correct project summarization outputs
- Correct skill grouping and ordering
- Proper functioning of new scan.py menu

Reflection:
This week was productive and structured. The team successfully reestablished momentum after the break. Several large features were completed or significantly improved, especially around project metadata accuracy, skill grouping, language detection, and contributor-focused summaries. Communication was strong, PR reviews were done early, and merge conflicts were avoided. With Milestone 1 approaching, the team feels confident but aware of the need to finalize demo-related features and polish the pipeline.

Planning Activities (Week 13)
- Prepare for Quiz 1 and Milestone 1 Presentation
- Finalize revisions to Language/framework detection, Chronological ranking and project metadata, Contribution summarization and Skill grouping
- Begin or continue résumé/portfolio generation, Retrieving previously stored résumés/portfolio entries, Completing any remaining Kanban tasks and clean up scan.py for the demo

## Overview:
This week, we focused on cleaning up our codebase and outputs before the end of Milestone 1. All group members committed quality PRs on time and contributed quality reviews while providing good feedback and improvements. There was no TA meeting this week, but we managed to stay on schedule as we prepare for the end of the semester. Daniel worked on cleaning up unnecessary outputs and summarising important information when scanning a project. Jaxson implemented our first iteration of the user's resume generation, which summarises all contributions from all scanned projects into a markdown file that will later be used for converting the resume to other formats (PDF, HTML). Priyanshu worked on refactoring skills exercised chronologically. This enhanced our modularity of the codebase by removing this deliverable from the old database test file into its own file. Travis added a big upgrade to the usability of our program by adding a main menu that allows users to select which part of the application they want to use, instead of running different files. Tyler refactored our JSON/TXT output to automatically save to the output folder after performing a new scan. Code reviews were performed by all members. This was a strong week for our group.

## Team Member's Completed Tasks:
### Daniel:
- Replaced noisy per-file printing inside of scan.py with a single line and run language/skill detectors via a captured runner so other noisy output is ignored
### Jaxson:
- Full resume generation feature that creates resume-ready Markdown files for a selected contributor by aggregating project exports stored under the output/ directory
- Team Logs for week 12
### Priyanshu:
- Refactored the Skills Exercised (Chronologically) logic out of inspect_db.py into a dedicated module, skill_timeline.py
### Tanner:
- Improved accuracy and coverage of the "detect programming frameworks" feature
- Updated data-access consent policy
### Travis:
- Full main_menu.py module that acts as a unified CLI interface for all major MDA features
### Tyler:
- Auto Output Key Information On Scan That Includes All New Analysis Info
### All Members:
- Code reviews and verification
- Completion of individual logs and peer reviews

## Testing Report:
All new and existing unit tests continue to pass successfully across both local and Docker environments. Validation was conducted through a combination of automated and manual testing.

#### `test_main_menu.py`  
- covers the deterministic and non-interactive portions of the module:
- print_main_menu() output
- safe_query() success and fallback paths
- human_ts() for standard, ISO, invalid, and None timestamps
- handle_inspect_database() using a temporary in-memory database

#### `test_generate_resume.py`
- Tests for normalize_project_name() including acronym preservation
- Tests for collect_projects() and aggregate_for_user() ensuring correct shapes and aggregation
- Tests for render_markdown(), including timestamp insertion and correct formatting

#### `scan_test.py`
- capture_output now returns both printed output and the function return value (output, rv).
- Tests assert on the returned data (rv) to verify which files were found.
- For entries from zip archives, tests split the display_path on ':' and take the last segment before using os.path.basename so comparisons match the new archive:path format.
- The collaboration test now calls get_collaboration_info(file_path) directly and asserts it returns 'unknown' when no git repo is present

#### `test_detect_langs.py`
- Removed the 3 pre-existing framework detection unit tests as they relied on deprecated logic that is no longer used
- Added 9 tests to ensure that detect_languages_and_frameworks() is accurately detecting 9 of the 18 supported frameworks by running detections on doctored config/package/dependency files
- I added 4 edge-case tests to ensure:
- Multiple frameworks can be detected in the same config/package/dependency file
   - No frameworks are detected when no config/package/dependency files exist in the project repository
   - Framework detections are performed case-insensitively (ie, "FLASK==version or flask==version" still detects as "Flask")

#### `consent_test.py`
- Hotfix that fixes a unit test within consent_test.py that was using deprecated Strings from the previous implementation of our data-access policy.
- Test ensures that when no strings are explicitly passed into describe_data_access(), it will return the default Strings that are hardcoded into the function.
- Now it checks that the four main headers from our updated data-access policy are found in the output. 

## Team Reflection:
This week, our team worked very well together. With the upcoming stress of Finals and end-of-semester projects coming to an end, we are making sure to complete our deliverables ahead of time to avoid unwanted stress. All members of the group were sufficiently active in our team's Discord chat and let everyone know what they were working on. All code was delivered in good time, and reviews were quick and with quality improvements and notes. We have been quite proactive with our preparation for the Milestone 1 presentation.

## Planned Activities (Week 14):
For week 14, we have discussed it as a team and decided that we hope to:
- Add finishing touches for Wednesday's Presentation
- Update System Architecture to reflect our current system
- Update Data Flow Diagram to reflect our current system
- Create Team Contract
- Milestone 1 Video Demo
- Milestone 1 Self-Reflection

## Overview
After completing Milestone 1 and returning from winter break, the team got back together in communication and began slowly introducing new features for Milestone 2. This week, the team made strong progress across core infrastructure, data quality, automation, and intelligence features. Jaxson implemented optional project thumbnail support throughout the scan workflow, including schema updates, migration handling, file validation, and full test coverage. Daniel introduced a low-level, heuristic-based role detection system that analyzes contribution patterns and file types to transparently infer contributor roles without using LLMs. Priyanshu improved data integrity by fixing duplicate scan issues, ensuring only the latest scan data is retained per project and adding cleanup logic with supporting tests. Tyler delivered a resume regeneration workflow, enabling automated rescans and resume updates with robust unit testing and seamless integration into existing menus and scan logic. Travis worked on the evidence of success feature that implements the backend storage + user management piece. Travis communicated to the team that he plans to continue working on this feature  to integrate output models (portfolio generation, resume export, markdown reports, etc.). Tanner introduced a core portfolio generation feature that creates sectional markdown files from scanned project data, reusing components from the resume generation system. It assembles project insights, technology summaries, and contribution metrics per user, saving the portfolios in the portfolios/ folder, with plans to later integrate viewing, database tracking, and enhanced contribution metrics.Overall, the team significantly advanced usability, reliability, automation, and analytical depth of the system.

- Jaxson Kahl --> jaxsonkahl
- Priyanshu Chugh --> priyanshupc04
- Tanner Dyck --> TannerDyck
- Travis Frank --> travis-frank
- Tyler Cummings --> TylerC-3042

## Overview
This week focused on improving system robustness, fixing critical bugs in nested folder scanning, and reworking core resume/portfolio generation logic. Daniel led the effort to fix nested folder scanning issues and added comprehensive tests. Jaxson reworked the resume and portfolio generation to properly source data from the database and updated the corresponding test suites. Priyanshu added project resume display name editing and cleaned up resume output by removing local paths and git metrics.

## Testing Report
All 222 new and existing unit tests pass successfully. Testing additions this week largely focused on nested folder handling and database schema initialization.

### Tests Added:
`test_scan.py`
Added tests for nested folder scanning scenarios, ensuring proper extraction of project data from complex directory structures.

`test_db_schema_init.py`
Comprehensive tests validating database schema auto-initialization, table creation, and startup behavior.

`test_generate_resume.py` / `test_generate_portfolio.py` / `test_api.py`
Updated tests to reflect reworked generation logic that sources data from database rather than direct scan results found in local JSON files.

`test_regenerate_resume.py` / `test_regenerate_portfolio.py`
Updated tests for regeneration workflows with new database-backed approach.

This is the result of running `py -m pytest test/ -W ignore::DeprecationWarning` on a Windows device on the latest build of Development branch before our end-of-week merge to main for T2 Week 3:

## Reflection
The entire team collaborated well together this week. Our in-class meeting on Wednesday went well, and gave us the opportunity to set clear goals for the rest of the week. We opted to focus on bug fixes and system stability in preparation for our upcoming peer testing event. We explicitly assigned major tasks and sequentially worked through a list of smaller bug fixes based on feedback from the teaching staff. Team members were active and helpful in the Discord, and collaborated to find solutions for encountered problems. All code additions were completed by Sunday evening, and I was given plenty of time to complete this team log entry as a result. Overall, the team seems to be very happy with our performance this week, and to keeping our momentum moving into the next one. 

## Plans for T2 Week 4:
Next week we will be participating in a class-wide peer testing event as mentioned above. It is likely that we will spend the majority of the early week preparing a final build of our program to be used during the peer testing. Post-Wednesday, we plan to continue onwards with larger features and further refinements to pre-existing features:
- Continue fixing bugs found during milestone 1
- LLM-assisted analysis integration
- Further informational separation between resumes and portfolios, as well as the ability to configure/edit the documents within the CLI
- Keeping README up to date with newly implemented features
